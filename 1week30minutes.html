      <p>
        As I am writing this, I am completing the last day of my 30 minutes a day for
        7 days challenge. It was a great success. Here are some statistics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I live streamed 6 out of the 7 days, most of the time with 1-2 concurrent viewers</li>
        <li>Sessions lasted for an average of 42 minutes, with the longest being 1:08 and the shortest being 30 minutes</li>
        <li>One session started at 2:00am</li>
        <li>3 blogging sessions, 3 programming sessions, and 1 administrative session</li>
        <li>All the sessions totaled 4 hours and 56 minutes!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I've never been this consistent on productive, non-work related projects over the course of a week.
        Seeing that I committed almost 5 hours towards things I am proud of made me
        happy and able to relax during dedicated leisure time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were two things that I attribute to the experiment being a success.
        First, the sessions only being 30 minutes really helped me commit to finishing
        each day. Because it's such a short time, on low-motivation days, it was easy
        to convince myself that a session won't be that too painful. Second, posting
        my session summary on Twitter helped build accountability. That last thing I
        wanted to do was expose a failure to my many followers ðŸ˜‚.
      </p>
      <h2>What's next</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to continue these session on a daily basis. If I miss a
        day, I will create a new goal for X amount of consecutive days. I also hope
        that my average session time increases, but that is something I will not be
        actively improving. I'm guessing that once this becomes a habit, I will
        naturally dedicate more time to each session.
      </p>
      <p>
        If/when I hit 30 consecutive days, I will do another reflection like this. I'm
        excited to see what I accomplish during that time!
