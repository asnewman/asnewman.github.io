      <h1>30 Minutes a Day</h1>
      <p>
        For the next 7 days, I will dedicate at least 30 minutes to activities that I know will both produce joy and content.
        Such activities will include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming small side projects</li>
        <li>Playing/creating music</li>
        <li>Writing blog posts</li>
        <li>Staring off into space</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are activities that I wish to do more of because I know at the end of doing them, I feel better.
        Ideally, I would like to have these sessions be longer (~1 hour), but 30 minutes felt like a number that isn't too intimidating to start with.
        I hope to have it become a habit that lasts longer than 7 days, but that is the bare minimum I promise to complete for this experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each session, I will try to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/borrimorri">live stream</a> what I am doing, but there probably will be days when live streaming doesn't make sense.
        In any case, I will post on <a href="https://twitter.com/edweirdsnowman">my twitter</a> what I did during the 30 minutes.
        I'll be doing this not for views, but more for a public record that I can look back on.
      </p>
      <p>I'm excited to start this experiment! In fact, this post was created during the first session.</p>

			<title>The Neglected Log In Button</title>

      <h1>The Neglected Log In Button</h1>
      <p>Ever visit a website you frequent and get frustrated that you can't find the log in button? For some reason that I can't comprehend, web designers love to highlight the "Sign Up" button and not the "Log In" button, communicating that potential users are more valuable than loyal, regular users. Here are some examples:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ppW3WGq.png" alt="twitter homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitter:</b> 4 obvious ways to sign up, 1 unhighlighted way to log in<span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPR4B5p.png" alt="twitch homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitch:</b> Better than Twitter, though still obviously wants to highlight "Sign Up" over "Log In"</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RknUrqJ.png" alt="github homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitHub:</b> 0 ways to log in, 2 ways to sign up</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/evX2gXW.png" alt="gitlab homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitLab:</b> GitHub's competitor doing no better</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Log In First</h2>
      <p>Sure, regular users are logged in most of the time they visit websites. But I can't think of a single reason why not to make log in just as apparent as sign up. It's a very mild inconvenience, but an avoidable one, so it shouldn't happen.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at a good example:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGJwoq1.png" alt="facebook homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <p>Facebook doesn't get a lot of praise nowadays, but this homepage is perfection. There is a clear way to log in, clear way to create an account, and no unnecessary content to distract the user. The more straightforward the web is, the better.</p>]]></content:encoded>
