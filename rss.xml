      <h1>When to Stop</h1>
      <p>
        I saw a drawing the other day about working that I really appreciated. I don‚Äôt remember the source, but it looked something like this:
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Hvqwpyr.png" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" alt="graphic about working" />
      <p>
        The message being to stop working before reaching exhaustion. The problem with 100% energy expenditure for work is that you won‚Äôt have any energy to do productive, non-work related activities afterward. These activities include cleaning, cooking, exercising, and doing hobbies. All these activities are essential to living a balanced life. Without them, burnout and mental deterioration will creep up and show no mercy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm fully aware that being able to freely decide whether to continue working or calling it for the day is not always possible. Luckily, there is another part of the day that one can be mindful of when it comes to stopping at the appropriate time. Indulging in pure pleasure, like watching shows, playing video games, or scrolling for memes on Instagram is an essential part of restoring one‚Äôs energy reserve. That being said, spending too much time indulging takes away from other non-work related activities, while also making the act of indulging no longer pleasurable. Take a look at the following graphic:
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/oU33byN.png" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" alt="graphic about indulging" />
      <p>
        There is a good portion representing the need for the mind to relax and rejuvenate. But too much can result in what I call ‚Äúzombie mode‚Äù. I often feel this after an hours-long binge of a reality show or playing video games. The activity is no longer fun, and I‚Äôm just mindlessly consuming it. In the end, I start to feel more exhausted and restless than before I started ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this is to say, living each day by expending all my energy at work, then transitioning to overindulgence has always left me feeling disconnected and dissatisfied with life. Every person is different, but I do think everyone has their limits in both realms. Navigating when to stop has helped me feel better about each day and I encourage everyone else to be mindful of it too.

			<title>Completed: 30 Minutes a Day</title>

      <p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
      <h1>Completed: 30 Minutes a Day</h1>
      <div style="background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 5px 0">
        <blockquote>"the most productive part of the 30 minutes is the 30 minutes after"</blockquote>
      </div>
      <p>
        As I am writing this, I am completing the last day of my 30 minutes a day for
        7 days challenge. It was a great success. Here are some statistics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I live streamed 6 out of the 7 days, most of the time with 1-2 concurrent viewers</li>
        <li>Sessions lasted for an average of 42 minutes, with the longest being 1:08 and the shortest being 30 minutes</li>
        <li>One session started at 2:00am</li>
        <li>3 blogging sessions, 3 programming sessions, and 1 administrative session</li>
        <li>All the sessions totaled 4 hours and 56 minutes!</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        I've never been this consistent on productive, non-work related projects over the course of a week.
        Seeing that I committed almost 5 hours towards things I am proud of made me
        happy and able to relax during dedicated leisure time.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were two things that I attribute to the experiment being a success.
        First, the sessions only being 30 minutes really helped me commit to finishing
        each day. Because it's such a short time, on low-motivation days, it was easy
        to convince myself that a session won't be that too painful. Second, posting
        my session summary on Twitter helped build accountability. That last thing I
        wanted to do was expose a failure to my many followers üòÇ.
      </p>
      <h2>What's next</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to continue these session on a daily basis. If I miss a
        day, I will create a new goal for X amount of consecutive days. I also hope
        that my average session time increases, but that is something I will not be
        actively improving. I'm guessing that once this becomes a habit, I will
        naturally dedicate more time to each session.
      </p>
      <p>
        If/when I hit 30 consecutive days, I will do another reflection like this. I'm
        excited to see what I accomplish during that time!

			<title>Shoshikantetsu</title>

			<description><![CDATA["Shoshi" translates to "original intent", and kantetsu translates to "to carry out".]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="max-width: 600px;">
      <p><a href="/">Home</a></p>
      <h1>Shoshikantetsu</h1>
      <p>
        The other day I was visiting my parents in Hawaii when I complained to my mother about not wanting to do a planned run that afternoon.
        I told her that I was tired and was dreading physical exercise.
        Despite that, I explained to her that I was going to do it, even if it meant I ran a lot slower than my regular pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I did go on my run, and sure enough, it was slow.
        I apologized to my mom for taking so long because I had planned to watch a show with her afterward.
        My mom, who is Japanese, told me it was all right and taught me a new term in Japanese called ÂàùÂøóË≤´Âæπ (shoshikantetsu).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shoshi" translates to "original intent", and kantetsu translates to "to carry out".
        Combined, it means to complete what was originally intended.
        In this case, I practiced "shoshikantetsu" by completing the planned run, despite my low motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mom printed the phrase out for me after she saw my interest in it.
      </p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pMwzJ4m.jpg" alt="shoshikantetsu print out" />
      <p>
        I've thought a lot about shoshikantetsu since then.
        Having a high say-do ratio has always been important to me, but I wanted to strategize a way to make sure my commitments were seen through to the end.
        What I ended up landing on was focusing on making the "original intent" small enough that I had no excuses to not complete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <a href="https://asnewman.github.io/30minutesaday">I'm currently experimenting with doing 30 minutes of enjoyable, productive activities once a day for 7 days</a>.
        Originally, I wanted to make this an hour per day life long habit.
        The truth is, such a grandiose original intend only sets you up for failure.
        By adjusting the experiment to something a lot less intense, it made it less intimidating.
        As a result, so far, performing my 30 minute duty feels easy, especially because I know after a week I can quit if I want.
        Of course I would like to continue the habit for as long as it works for me, and reducing the pressure to achieve it is probably the best way to promote consistency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, there are many 4 letter Japanese idioms out there. Some other interesting ones include:
        <ul>
          <li>‰∏ÄÊúü‰∏Ä‰ºö (ichigoichie) - "Treasure every encounter, for it will never recur."</li>
          <li>‰∏ÄÊó•‰∏ÄÊ≠© (iichinichiippo) - "One step each day."</li>
          <li>ÂçÅ‰∫∫ÂçÅËâ≤  (j≈´nintoiro) - "To each their own; So many people, so many minds"</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's great to learn new phrases/idioms, especially when you allow it to change how you think about life.
        I'm sure shoshikantetsu will stick with me as I continue to create goals for myself in the future.

      <h1>30 Minutes a Day</h1>
      <p>
        For the next 7 days, I will dedicate at least 30 minutes to activities that I know will both produce joy and content.
        Such activities will include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming small side projects</li>
        <li>Playing/creating music</li>
        <li>Writing blog posts</li>
        <li>Staring off into space</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are activities that I wish to do more of because I know at the end of doing them, I feel better.
        Ideally, I would like to have these sessions be longer (~1 hour), but 30 minutes felt like a number that isn't too intimidating to start with.
        I hope to have it become a habit that lasts longer than 7 days, but that is the bare minimum I promise to complete for this experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each session, I will try to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/borrimorri">live stream</a> what I am doing, but there probably will be days when live streaming doesn't make sense.
        In any case, I will post on <a href="https://twitter.com/edweirdsnowman">my twitter</a> what I did during the 30 minutes.
        I'll be doing this not for views, but more for a public record that I can look back on.
      </p>
      <p>I'm excited to start this experiment! In fact, this post was created during the first session.</p>

			<title>The Neglected Log In Button</title>

      <h1>The Neglected Log In Button</h1>
      <p>Ever visit a website you frequent and get frustrated that you can't find the log in button? For some reason that I can't comprehend, web designers love to highlight the "Sign Up" button and not the "Log In" button, communicating that potential users are more valuable than loyal, regular users. Here are some examples:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ppW3WGq.png" alt="twitter homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitter:</b> 4 obvious ways to sign up, 1 unhighlighted way to log in<span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPR4B5p.png" alt="twitch homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitch:</b> Better than Twitter, though still obviously wants to highlight "Sign Up" over "Log In"</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RknUrqJ.png" alt="github homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitHub:</b> 0 ways to log in, 2 ways to sign up</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/evX2gXW.png" alt="gitlab homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitLab:</b> GitHub's competitor doing no better</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Log In First</h2>
      <p>Sure, regular users are logged in most of the time they visit websites. But I can't think of a single reason why not to make log in just as apparent as sign up. It's a very mild inconvenience, but an avoidable one, so it shouldn't happen.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at a good example:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGJwoq1.png" alt="facebook homepage" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <p>Facebook doesn't get a lot of praise nowadays, but this homepage is perfection. There is a clear way to log in, clear way to create an account, and no unnecessary content to distract the user. The more straightforward the web is, the better.</p>]]></content:encoded>
