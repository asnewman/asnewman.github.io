      <h1>Shoshikantetsu</h1>
      <p>
        The other day I was visiting my family in Hawaii when I complained to my mother about not wanting to do a planned run that afternoon.
        I told her that I was tired and was dreading physical exercise.
        Despite that, I explained to her that I was going to do it, even if it meant I ran a lot slower than my regular pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, I did go on my run, and sure enough, it was slow.
        I apologized to my mom for taking so long because I had planned to watch a show with her afterward.
        My mom, who is Japanese, told me it was all right and taught me a new term in Japanese called 初志貫徹 (shoshikantetsu).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Shoshi" translates to "original intent", and kantetsu translates to "to carry out".
        Combined, it means to complete what was originally intended.
        In this case, I practiced "shoshikantetsu" by completing the planned run, despite my low motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My mom printed the phrase out for me after she saw my interest in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've thought a lot about shoshikantetsu since then.
        Having a high say-do ratio has always been important to me, but I wanted to strategize a way to make sure my commitments were seen through to the end.
        What I ended up landing on was focusing on making the "original intent" small enough that I had no excuses to not complete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <a href="https://asnewman.github.io/30minutesaday">I'm currently experimenting with doing 30 minutes of enjoyable, productive activities once a day for 7 days</a>.
        Originally, I wanted to make this an hour per day life long habit.
        The truth is, such a grandiose original intend only sets you up for failure.
        By adjusting the experiment to something a lot less intense, it made it less intimidating.
        As a result, so far, performing my 30 minute duty feels easy, especially because I know after a week I can quit if I want.
        Of course I would like to continue the habit for as long as it works for me, and reducing the pressure to achieve it is probably the best way to promote consistency.
      </p>

        Apparently, there are many 4 letter Japanese idioms out there. Some other interesting ones include:
        <ul>
          <li>一期一会 (ichigoichie) - "Treasure every encounter, for it will never recur."</li>
          <li>一日一歩 (iichinichiippo) - "One step each day."</li>
          <li>十人十色  (jūnintoiro) - "To each their own; So many people, so many minds"</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's great to learn new phrases/idioms, especially when you allow it to change how you think about life.
        I'm sure shoshikantetsu will stick with me as I continue to create goals for myself in the future.
