        <h1>30 Days 30 Minutes</h1>
        <p>I am happy to report that I&#39;ve completed 30 days straight of my <a
                href="https://asnewman.github.io/30minutesaday">30 minutes daily challenge</a>. It took me 55 days to
            complete due to a couple broken streaks. Looking back at my <a
                href="https://asnewman.github.io/1week30minutes">7 day report</a>, I wanted to increase the amount of
            time I spent in each session (e.g. more than 30 minutes). I can confidently say that the average time has
            increased, though I don&#39;t have any concrete numbers since I didn&#39;t record any of it. I also have to
            admit on some days I didn&#39;t complete a full 30 minutes, but I&#39;m happy I at least did some work.</p>

        <p>Some of the things I worked on include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Rewriting (part of) simplestat.us in Python</li>
            <li>Blog post <a href="https://asnewman.github.io/when-to-stop">When to Stop</a></li>
            <li>Work on my &quot;fun&quot; editor</li>
            <li>Blog post <a href="https://asnewman.github.io/self-help">Self-help</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://nomodoom.com/">Nomodoom </a>bug fix</li>
            <li><a href="https://just-read.vercel.app/">Just Read</a> project</li>
            <li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/just-read-text-to-speech/">Just Read</a> firefox
                extension project</li>
            <li>Work on a game project</li>

            </li>
            <li>Blog post <a href="https://asnewman.github.io/positive-monster">Positive Monster</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can find the exhaustive list on my <a href="https://twitter.com/edweirdsnowman">Twitter page</a>.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m ecstatic that I could accomplish all the things above while having a full-time job and maintaining a
            balanced life.</p>

        <p>One thing that stands out to me is how dispersed my efforts were. I don&#39;t think that is a bad thing, but
            I wonder how much I can get done if I focus on one thing for a set amount of time. As a result, my next
            experiment will be to work on my game for 7 days straight.</p>

        <p>I&#39;m still planning to continue the 30 minutes a day activity, but I will report less about it on my
            Twitter page. Instead of daily posts, I will only report significant progress updates about my projects to
            reduce spam. However, if I become inconsistent with the 30 minutes because of this, I will revert back to my
            original posting schedule.</p>
