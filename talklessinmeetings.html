      <h1>Talk Less in Meetings</h1>
      <p>
        My first manager noticed something I did unintentionally in meetings
        early in my career. He told me I was quiet in meetings, but everyone
        listened carefully on the rare occasions I spoke. He explained this was
        a great trait: striving to be the most impactful person in the room, not
        the loudest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is, I was probably either overwhelmed trying to absorb
        information (I was a super junior engineer at the time) or nervous/shy
        to speak whatever was on my mind. Nonetheless, my manager’s words have
        stuck with me throughout my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advice to focus on fewer, more impactful words is hard for some
        people to hear, especially for those who equate more words to more
        intelligence and influence. But there are two strong reasons why I think
        that mindset is not optimal:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. The longer you go without speaking, the more time you have to gain
        context and think through your thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raw thoughts are great during brainstorming sessions. However, in other
        settings, they can derail the conversation and even cause the speaker to
        confuse themselves. The longer you let thoughts in your mind sit, the
        more well-formed and valuable they will be when they come out of your
        mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. The more time you spend listening, the more you can learn from your
        peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this one, the adage “If you're the smartest person in the room,
        you're in the wrong room” comes to mind. But I don’t think it’s ever
        possible to be in “the wrong room.” It may be true that you can be the
        most knowledgeable about a specific topic. Still, regardless of
        experience or background, every person has the potential to contribute
        novel ideas. In fact, sometimes the lack of experience is precisely what
        you need for a fresh perspective to be discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, I love the idea of treating everyone as your
        “master” because that mindset will inevitably result in learning
        something from anyone who shares ideas and asks questions. The problem
        is, if you talk too much, you don’t allow those ideas and questions to
        be shared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not to remain silent but to strike a balance between
        speaking and listening. If you have a great idea, don’t hesitate to
        share it. But if you walk away from a meeting feeling like you dominated
        the conversation, there’s a good chance the entire group missed out on
        something great.
