# Thoughts on The Remains of the Day
The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro is a book that hits you from two angles. On the surface, it’s a story of a butler devoted to his work, someone who finds real meaning in doing his job well. I loved that part of the book. There’s something inspiring about watching a person pour so much purpose into their career that it becomes the core of who they are.

But the story is also a cautionary one. The main character, Stevens, takes his work so seriously that it blinds him to parts of his own life. By the end, you’re left with the weight of his regrets. The moments he missed, relationships he never allowed himself to have, a life narrowed by duty that eventually left him with very little outside of it.

I walked away feeling conflicted in the best possible way. I admire his dedication and I want that level of purpose in my own work. At the same time, I don’t want to wake up one day realizing that the things I cared about most were neglected because I was too focused on my work.

If you want a story about someone who is incredibly passionate about their craft, and a thoughtful look at what that passion can give and what it can cost, I highly recommend this book.
