# Use Travel Guide Books
I’m currently traveling in Kyoto, and despite speaking Japanese, I wanted to be prepared to navigate this unfamiliar city. As a result, I picked up a guide book before the trip, and it’s been incredibly useful.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img style="max-width: 400px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asnewman/asnewman.github.io/refs/heads/main/assets/travel-guide-book.png" alt="My travel guide book for Kyoto" />
  <p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 8px;">My travel guide book for Kyoto</p>
</div>

I bought it because I wanted something that recommended places other than the usual viral Instagram spots, didn’t rely on internet access, wasn’t in video form, offered detail on each recommendation, and came with zero ads.

So far, it’s completely delivered. I’m getting a rich picture of Kyoto, and I’ll definitely be looking for guide books on future trips.
