# Small Perks, Big Benefits

When thinking about important company benefits for employee happiness, the first things that come to mind are good health insurance, dental and vision, and maybe a 401(k). Those matter a lot, of course. But I’ve found that some of the most efficient dollars a company can spend come from creative benefits that directly improve day-to-day employee well-being.

Two examples stand out for me.

At a previous employer, we were given an annual health stipend that we could use on almost anything health-related. Fitness equipment, workout classes, massages, and even house cleanings. At the end of the year, when the stipend was set to expire, you could hear excitement across the company about what people spent it on and how grateful they were for the benefit.

At my current workplace, Ditto, we get a $50 monthly book stipend. With my reading speed, that basically means unlimited books. What I love most is that Ditto doesn’t prescribe what kind of book you should get. Sometimes people pick up something directly relevant to the job and level up their skills. Other times, they grab a totally random book just because it interests them. Both are great. The first helps people grow in ways that benefit the company, and the second sparks conversations and recommendations that contribute to the culture. And the truth is, this benefit brings far more happiness than a $50/mo raise ever would.

Every business leader should look for creative benefits like these. They’re inexpensive, memorable, and incredibly effective at making people happier and more energized at work. Few things add as much value for as little cost.
