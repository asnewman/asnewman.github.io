# Do Performance Reviews

One thing that surprises me when I talk to developers, especially those working at startups, is how often performance reviews are neglected. I hear stories from people who spent years at a company without ever having a formal review. To me, that’s a great failure on both the manager and the employee. But why are they important?

First, they provide a clear checkpoint to evaluate compensation. Pay increases should not be mysterious or reactive. A structured review creates a natural moment to assess impact, growth, and whether compensation still reflects the value someone brings to the company.

But just as important, performance reviews create dedicated space for feedback. Even on small teams, it’s surprisingly easy to misread how your manager feels about your work.

A review forces that conversation to happen. It gives managers a responsibility to articulate how they think you’re doing, what they appreciate, and what they want you to focus on next. That clarity is incredibly valuable. It turns vague assumptions into explicit expectations.

In most cases, even when someone is doing great work, there are still areas their manager wants them to lean into more. That doesn’t mean something is wrong. Often, it’s the opposite. Without a review, that insight can stay locked in someone else’s head.

At a minimum, everyone should have a formal performance check-in every six months. They help people understand where they stand, what matters most, and how best to move forward for the company and their career. Without them, so much is left to vague, easily mistaken interpretation.
