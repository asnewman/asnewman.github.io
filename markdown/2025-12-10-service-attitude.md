# Service Attitude

I have a lot of respect for people in the service industry who take their job seriously. It is why I love [The Remains of the Day](https://ajkprojects.com/thoughts-on-remains-of-the-day.html), a book about a world class butler.

Service work has two sides. There is the actual task the service provides and there is the way you interact with the person you are serving. When someone treats both parts with seriousness and passion, I find it deeply respectable.

It makes me think about how we work in tech. Many people in tech do their jobs well, but I think we need to pay more attention to something I call a service attitude.

Here is my hot take. It is important to encourage discussion and disagreement at the right times, but too many people approach work with a self-serving or self-entitled mindset. Instead, they should approach it with a "service attitude".

A service attitude encourages collaboration and creates a positive environment. And the truth is, no matter how good you are, if you are unpleasant, if you shut people down, or treat others as lower than you, you make the workplace worse, and that always hurts the business.
