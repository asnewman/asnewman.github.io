# Advent of Writing Reflection

I’ve finished my Advent of Writing challenge, which required me to write every day between December 1st and Dec 24th. This was the first challenge I did as part of my Hobby Depth project. In total, I wrote 16 blog posts covering topics such as life, personal experiences, and management.

Here’s a list of all the posts that were made:
- [Hobby Depth](https://ajkprojects.com/hobby-depth.html)

I started the challenge by writing and posting every day. This was great at first because it created strong momentum. But I soon felt that some posts didn’t go as deep as they needed to. So at the tail end of the challenge, I focused on writing every day instead of posting, which felt better. As a result, I could see myself going back and supplementing some of the posts or writing revised versions.

I was particularly happy with how the challenge went because for most of it I was traveling, which added an extra layer of discipline. In addition, I came away with a few positive points:
- Ideas that have been stuck in my head for a while are finally written down
- I’ve strengthened the muscle to get past the mental barrier of starting blog posts
- I’m now in a rhythm of regularly writing

So this project was a success! I will continue to write regularly, but I don’t feel the need to extend this challenge, and I am eager to move on to the next thing. Speaking of which, for my next project, I will spend about a week working on an iOS app to help me quickly edit my yearly year-end video montage. This app will be called “Moments” and will be released to the app store. I will make sure to write a blog post about it once it is done.
