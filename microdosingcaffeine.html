      <h1>Micro-dosing Caffeine</h1>
      <p style="margin-top: -10px; font-size: .7rem;">How I manage my caffeine intake.</p>
      <p>I was late to the game when it comes to caffeine exposure. Since high school, I’ve struggled with migraines, and because caffeine is a well-known trigger, I stayed away from it as much as possible.</p>
      <p>In college, I remember feeling jealous of people using and abusing caffeine. To be able to legally ingest a substance that helped you stay awake and focus before exams almost felt like an unfair advantage to me.</p>
      <p>A year and a half ago, noticing a decrease in my migraine frequency, I became curious about the real-world benefits of caffeine. Based on what I saw in college and finding out that Bill Gates and John Carmack are both Diet Coke addicts, I had high expectations.</p>
      <p>So I went and got a can of Coke and drank it during work. As this was essentially my first caffeine experience, I was highly sensitive and became instantly wired. The hype in my head was real. I got so much work done that day and I couldn’t help but feel that all this time I’d been operating in a slower-paced, less-focused universe compared to my peers.</p>
      <p>I was so excited that I raved about my experience with a few people I knew. Most people laughed and many were envious about how effective one can of coke was to me. I soon came to find that a lot of my peers require far more caffeine just to be at a baseline level of operation.</p>
      <p>I decided to do some research on YouTube where I found people like Wheezy Waiter, Beau Miles, and Christian Schaffer all suffering from caffeine withdrawals during experiments where they stopped drinking coffee.</p>
      <p>I realized that caffeine addiction is real, and once you are hooked, the powerful benefits that I experienced are far less potent. So I came up with a plan to manage my caffeine intake that I’ve stuck to for over a year now.</p>
      <p>My general rules are the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I don’t exceed 60 mg of caffeine in one day. To give perspective, a can of Diet Coke is 46mg. A grande latte from Starbucks is 150mg. Therefore, I cannot drink a fully caffeinated latte drink.</li>
        <li>I only drink caffeine on days that I need the extra boost to be productive. I am very intentional about not wasting it on days that require less productivity.</li>
        <li>I limit myself to a maximum of four caffeine days per week, ideally fewer.</li>
        <li>Avoid caffeinated drinks that are customized. Starbucks gives the option to get 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, caffeinated beverages. This is great because it opens up many caffeine options, but I don’t like to do it too often as I’ve had a few too many times where the barista makes the drink incorrectly. Because of my high caffeine sensitivity, I realize quickly when a drink has more caffeine than I’m used to. For this reason, when I do go to Starbucks, I tend to get a Tall Matcha Latte (55mg of caffeine).</li>
        <li>I do my best to keep caffeine sources out of immediate reach. I have some green tea at home, but generally, I make it so I have to leave the house to source my caffeine. This makes me intentional about marking a day for more-than-normal productivity needs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Following these rules, I can effectively micro-dose caffeine, enjoying its potent effects from just a can of Coke without any dependency side effects. It’s great to have something that can reliably increase my mental performance when I need it.</p>
      <p>I know caffeine affects people differently, so I’d love to hear how other people manage their caffeine intake (even if it is complete dependence).  Please email me at ashleynewman@protonmail.com to start a conversation.</p>
