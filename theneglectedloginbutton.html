      <h1>The Neglected Log In Button</h1>
      <p>Ever visit a website you frequent and get frustrated that you can't find the log in button? For some reason that I can't comprehend, web designers love to highlight the "Sign Up" button and not the "Log In" button, communicating that potential users are more valuable than loyal, regular users. Here are some examples:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ppW3WGq.png" alt="twitter homepage" width="600" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitter:</b> 4 obvious ways to sign up, 1 unhighlighted way to log in<span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xPR4B5p.png" alt="twitch homepage" width="600" />
      <br />
      <span><b>Twitch:</b> Better than Twitter, though still obviously wants to highlight "Sign Up" over "Log In"</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RknUrqJ.png" alt="github homepage" width="600" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitHub:</b> 0 ways to log in, 2 ways to sign up</span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/evX2gXW.png" alt="gitlab homepage" width="600" />
      <br />
      <span><b>GitLab:</b> GitHub's competitor doing no better</span>
      <br />

      <h2>Log In First</h2>
      <p>Sure, regular users are logged in most of the time they visit websites. But I can't think of a single reason why not to make log in just as apparent as sign up. It's a very mild inconvenience, but an avoidable one, so it shouldn't happen.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at a good example:</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/uGJwoq1.png" alt="facebook homepage" width="600"/>
      <p>Facebook doesn't get a lot of praise nowadays, but this homepage is perfection. There is a clear way to log in, clear way to create an account, and no unnecessary content to distract the user. The more straightforward the web is, the better.</p>
