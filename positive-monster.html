      <h1>Positive Monster</h1>
      <p>I’m watching a Japanese show on Netflix called “The Full-Time Wife Escapist”. At one point in the show, a man calls a woman a “Positive Monster”, which she then nicknames “Posimon”.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/S5ksFUA.png" alt="posimon" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />
      <p>The idea of a creature gobbling up and spewing positivity is really amusing to me. Though becoming a monster of positivity probably isn’t what we should strive for, I’ve used it as a useful tool in my life. For example, when I’m feeling down, becoming a temporary Posimon is an effective way out of a rut. Though it was used as an insult in the show, funny enough, it’s something positive that I’ve added to my life. </p>
