      <h1>30 Minutes a Day</h1>
      <p>
        For the next 7 days, I will dedicate at least 30 minutes to activities that I know will both produce joy and content.
        Such activities will include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming small side projects</li>
        <li>Playing/creating music</li>
        <li>Writing blog posts</li>
        <li>Staring off into space</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are activities that I wish to do more of because I know at the end of doing them, I feel better.
        Ideally, I would like these sessions to be longer (~1 hour), but 30 minutes felt like a number that isn't too intimidating to start with.
        I hope to have it become a habit that lasts longer than 7 days, but that is the bare minimum I promise to complete for this experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each daily session, I will try to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/borrimorri">live stream</a> what I am doing, but there probably will be days when live streaming doesn't make sense.
        In any case, I will post on <a href="https://twitter.com/edweirdsnowman">my twitter</a> what I did during the 30 minutes.
        I'll be doing this not for views, but for a public record that I can look back on.
      </p>
      <p>I'm excited to start this experiment! In fact, this post was created during the first session.</p>
