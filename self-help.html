      <h1>Self-help</h1>
      <p>I was on the plane the other day writing my blog post <a href="/when-to-quit">&ldquo;When to Quit&rdquo;</a> when I started to think about self-help.<br>
      Why is it so popular?<br>
      Why do we find it so useful?</p>

      <p>The truth is, I find most self-help advice to be obvious.<br>
      Rarely do I read a self-help book or post and find it revolutionary.<br>
      I think this about my self-help posts too.</p>

      <p>While writing, I often wonder if anyone will find my advice useful.<br>
      I imagine myself as a reader thinking &ldquo;Duh, obviously I shouldn&rsquo;t overwork myself or watch too much TV&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>But the true power of self-help is learning new tactics to achieve these obvious goals in life.<br>
      Gamification, mindset shifts, and experimentation are all the real fruits of self-help.<br>
      And it&rsquo;s awesome if you&rsquo;re like me and love trying new self-help tactics because of all the content out there.</p>

      <p>But there&rsquo;s also a dangerous side to the abundance.</p>

      <h2>Self-Help Addiction</h2>
      <p>Caleb Schoep has a piece called <a href="https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2022/productivity-porn/">&ldquo;Productivity Porn&rdquo;</a>.<br>
      I recommend reading it, but the TLDR is this:<br>
      Consuming content about productive people or how to be productive can replace the need to actually be productive.<br>
      The same applies to self-help.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve seen myself fall into a trap that goes something like this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Finish reading a self-help book that has tons of great advice.</li>
        <li>Feel that my life has already improved because it was so insightful.</li>
        <li>Get the urge to experiment and implement the newly gained knowledge, but that requires work, so I&rsquo;ll watch a YouTube video about someone doing it instead.</li>
        <li>YouTuber validates how great everything is now, and I get so excited that I made the right choice to have read the book.</li>
        <li>I wonder what other wonderful self-help advice there is, so I find recommendations and buy another book off Amazon to start the cycle over again.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The problem is that life hasn&rsquo;t changed since reading the book.<br>
      I only temporarily feel better because of the exciting new knowledge, but after the high is gone, I still have the same life problems.</p>

      <p>There&rsquo;s some clear personal responsibility failure here, but I know I&rsquo;m not the only one who does this, and there&rsquo;s a reason for it.</p>

      <h2>It&rsquo;s a Business</h2>
      <p>A big problem with self-help content is how they describe themselves and how much it hypes the reader.<br>
      Look at the cover or back of any self-help book.<br>
      You&rsquo;ll quickly see exaggerated promises and highlighted reviews about how life-changing the content is.</p>

      <p>For example, &ldquo;The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck&rdquo;&rsquo;s website has some great snippets like the following:<br>
      <i>Note: I chose this book because it was my, and many others, first book in the self-help genre.</i></p>

      <p>&ldquo;This breakout, mega bestseller is the self-help book for people who hate self-help. It&rsquo;s as much a pat on the back as a slap in the face. It&rsquo;s the first truly no BS guide to flourishing in a crazy, crazy world&mdash;a truly counterintuitive approach to living a good life.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>Wow. This sounds awesome! It&rsquo;s not like the other self-help books. This is real and the others are just full of BS! (I&rsquo;m not trying to be sarcastic, this is legitimately what I thought many years ago when I picked up the book).</p>

      <p>Scroll down a bit, and you&rsquo;ll find amazing reviews from notable people (funny enough most from other self-help authors).</p>
      
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/dmErccL.png" alt="image of reviews" style="max-width:600px;width:100%" />

      <p>And the truth is, none of this is evil.<br>
      The book is good - I&rsquo;ve learned things from it.<br>
      But as readers, we need to give ourselves a reality check.</p>

      <p>Reading this book at best improved my life by 1-2%, which is great, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it matches the hype I got when I read about it.<br>
      This letdown becomes really apparent after reading the 10th self-help book in a row described as life-changing.<br>
      How can all these books promise life-changing results, but after reading them all I&rsquo;m not a levitating life guru creating Nirvana on earth?</p>

      <p>The reality is that the self-help industry is not a charity.<br>
      Lots of people make lots of money off of this stuff, and that&rsquo;s not a terrible thing (I wouldn&rsquo;t mind making money off of my writing one day).<br>
      But there is a bit of a conflict of interest.</p>

      <p>If everyone wants you to buy their life-changing book or watch their eye-opening YouTube video, they need to make it as enticing as possible.<br>
      The result is, as consumers, we don&rsquo;t take the time to fully absorb what we learned since it&rsquo;s so easy to get distracted by what&rsquo;s next.</p>

      <h2>A Confession</h2>
      <p>To be honest, I feel slightly weird when I write self-help blog posts.<br>
      Who am I to give advice?<br>
      I&rsquo;m just someone trying to live a fulfilling life, exactly like everyone else.<br>
      And a lot of the &ldquo;advice&rdquo; I write about is myself exploring and sharing what is working at the time.<br>
      Because of this, it isn&rsquo;t unusual for me to look back on posts and think, &ldquo;Oh right, I used to do/think that.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>But writing and sharing this stuff has been critical in improving my life.<br>
      So in a sense, my &ldquo;cosplaying&rdquo; as a source of self-help for other people is really just myself practicing self-help.<br>
      And if people get inspired to try something out by it, that makes it worth continuing despite my criticisms about self-help.<br>
      In the end, there is value that can be had from consuming and producing self-help content, but we all need to be mindful of the realities of what it can and can&rsquo;t do for us.</p>
